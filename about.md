I was born in Brighton and have lived locally ever since. I attended Saltdean Primary School, Longhill High School and 
Varndean College, finally ending up at the University of Sussex where I obtained my Astrophysics MPhys., PhD in 
Astronomy and worked as a Research Fellow for 4 years.


I am a Brighton and Hove Albion fan and season ticket holder, enjoy fishing (though notorious for not catching any) and
playing the piano.
 
I have recently become obsessed with growing my own veg using the no-dig method, made famous by 
Charles Dowding and entertaining by Tony C. Smith.
