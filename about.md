I was born in Brighton and have lived locally ever since. I attended Saltdean Primary School, Longhill High School and 
Varndean College, finally ending up at the University of Sussex where I obtained my Astrophysics MPhys., PhD in Astronomy and currently working as Research Fellow.

I am a Brighton and Hove Albion fan and season ticket holder, enjoy fishing, playing the piano and the occasional round of golf.
