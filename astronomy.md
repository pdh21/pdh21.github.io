## [![](https://github.com/H-E-L-P/XID_plus/blob/master/docs/images/Help_Logo.png?raw=true)](http://herschel.sussex.ac.uk)
I was project scientist for the [Herschel Extragalatic Legacy Project (HELP)](http://herschel.sussex.ac.uk), a multi-million pound project funded by the European Unionâ€™s Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under grant agreement no 607254.

### [XID+](http://herschel.sussex.ac.uk/XID_plus)
One of my main roles in HELP, was to develop XID+, the probabilistic deblender for confusion dominated maps. The software documentation can be found [here](http://herschel.sussex.ac.uk/XID_plus) and published paper [here](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1606.05770).

### PhD Thesis: [Untangling the physical components of galaxies using infrared spectra](http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/51433/)
During my PhD, I applied machine learning techniques such Principal Component Analysis ([Hurley et al. 2012](http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/44487/)) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorisation ([Hurley et al. 2014](http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/54330/))
to the spectra of galaxies in order to blindly learn the underlying physical components of galaxies.
 
 I also carried out molecular carbon monoxide spectral line modelling for the galaxy IC342 ([Rigopoulou et al. 2013](https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stt1149)) and the spectral line modelling of water
  molecules for the high redshift galaxy, HFLS3 ([Riechers et al. 2013](http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/46554/)).
