I am currently project scientist for the [Herschel Extragalatic Legacy Project (HELP)](http://herschel.sussex.ac.uk), a multi-million pound project funded by the European Unionâ€™s Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration under grant agreement no 607254.

### XID+
One of my main roles in HELP, has been to develop XID+, the probabilistic deblender for confusion dominated maps. The software documentation can be found [here](http://herschel.sussex.ac.uk/XID_plus) and published paper [here](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1606.05770).
