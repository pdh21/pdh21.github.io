description: An introductory blog post for a series on energy in the home
---

Over the last couple of years, I like many people, have begun to take more of an active interest in renewable energy and my own
 energy consumption. Having watched countless [Fully Charged](www.fullycharged.show) YouTube videos on renewable energy and EVs, I decided to look into getting solar panels and battery storage.
  After much deliberation, we decided to go with a UK company, [Moixa](www.moixa.com) who have their own 4.8 kWh smart
   battery and GridShare cloud based software to control when the battery charges. Ever since it was installed, me and 
   my wife have been endlessly checking up on solar generation and battery charge level. 
   
I have now decided to move up a nerd level by carrying out some of my own short projects and blog posts around my 
own solar generation, storage and energy consumption. In particular, I am looking to investigate:

 * Solar PV forecasts (both existing and how to go about generating my own)
 * Compare Time of Use (TOU) tariffs alongside my energy consumption
 * How to optimise battery charging given TOU tariffs and Solar PV forecasts
 
 Watch out for some of those blog posts over the next month or two!
