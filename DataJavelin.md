In the beginning of 2018, Philip Rooney, Colin Hayhurst and myself set up DataJavelin, a machine learning consultancy
 enterprise unit within the Data Intensive Science Centre at University of Sussex. By the summer of 2018, having proven 
 there was a viable market, I decided to take the leap of leaving academia and spin DataJavelin Ltd. out as private 
 company.
 
 Since then, we have been awarded a place on the NatWest Entrepeneur Accelerator program and have worked on numerous
  projects.
